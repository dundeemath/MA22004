# Lab Guide {-}

You will learn about the statistical programming language `R` and the software RStudio by working through seven interactive lab tutorials and completing lab reports. The lab reports should answer the exercise questions at the end of each tutorial. 

Tutorials and all associated materials (templates, data sets, further instructions, etc.) are available as an `R` package at the GitHub repository `dundeemath/MA22004labs` (i.e., [https://github.com/dundeemath/MA22004labs](https://github.com/dundeemath/MA22004labs)).  

Instructions on how to install and access the interactive lab tutorials can be found at:

The following section contains details about writing lab reports.
