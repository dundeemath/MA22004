# Deadlines {-#deadlines}

The module's deadlines and important dates are listed in the table below (this information is also available on MyDundee in the Assessments section following the University template). 

The two class tests (T1, T2) are timetabled. Please remember that you must engage with the weekly peer learning exercises on Perusall **before** the seminar meeting on Thursday mornings. The lab reports (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7) are due on Friday evenings at 17:00. 

```{r table-deadlines, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "An overview of all deadlines and important dates associated with the MA22004."}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
df <- tibble(read_csv("data/deadlines.csv")) %>% relocate(Topics, .after = Week) %>% relocate('Perusall Readings', .after = Topics)
kbl(df, booktabs = T) %>%
 kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))
```

T1 and T2 are on Fridays (F) from 15:00-17:00. Further details about the class tests will be circulated nearer the relevant deadline.
