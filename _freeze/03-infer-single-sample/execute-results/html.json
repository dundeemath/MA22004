Presently we estimate population means $\\mu$ in @sec-estimating-means, population proportions $p$ in @sec-estimating-proportions, and population variances $\\sigma^2$ in @sec-estimating-variances in some special cases.  \n\n## Estimating means {#sec-estimating-means}\n\nIf the parameter of interest is the population mean $\\theta = \\mu$, then what can be said about the distribution of the sample mean estimator $\\widehat{\\theta} = \\overline{X}$ in @eq-sample-mean? We will consider three cases,\n\n1. [normal population with known $\\sigma^2$](#sec-mean-normal-var-known),\n2. [any population with unknown $\\sigma^2$, when the sample size $m$ is large](#sec-mean-large-sample), and\n3. [normal population with unknown $\\sigma^2$, when the sample size $m$ is small](#sec-mean-normal-var-unknown).  \n\nIn each, the form of the confidence interval and hypothesis test statistic for $\\mu$ can be derived using the approximate normality of the sample mean.\n\nIn general, the confidence intervals for the mean based on normality theory will have the form:\n$$\n \\text{point estimate}\\; \\mu \\pm (\\text{critical value}) \\cdot (\\text{precision of point estimate})\\,, \n$$ {#eq-ci-gen-form}\nwhere the reference distribution will be the standard normal (for 1. and 2.) and the Student's $\\mathsf{t}$ distribution (for 3.). The critical value corresponds to the value under the reference distribution that yields the two-sided (symmetric) tail areas summing to $1-\\alpha.$  \n\n### Mean of a normal population with known variance {#sec-mean-normal-var-known}\n\nWhen sampling from a normal population with a known mean and variance, the estimator for the sample mean is also normal with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2/m$ where $m$ is the sample size.

The proportion $p \\in (0,1)$ of the population satisfying the given property is a parameter characterising the population we might be interested in estimating. A sample of classified observations, $X_1, \\dots, X_m \\sim \\mathsf{Bernoulli}(p)\\,,$ \nfrom the population contains a proportion,\n$$\n \\widehat{p} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m X_i\\,,\n$$ {#eq-proportion-estimator}\nsatisfying the given property.

Indeed, this normal approximation works well for moderately large $m$ as long as $p$ is not too close to zero or one; a rule of thumb is that $mp > 5$ and $m(1-p) > 5.$\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Rule of thumb\n\nFor estimating proportions, a rule of thumb is $m \\leq 0.05 M.$\n\nNote that if $m$ is large relative to $M$ ($m > 0.05 M$) then the variance @eq-proportion-var must be adjusted by a factor (related to the hypergeometric distribution):\n$$\n \\sigma_{\\widehat{p}}^2 = \\frac{p(1-p)}{m} \\frac{M-m}{M-1}\\,,\n$$\nwhere for fixed $m$ the factor converges to $1$ as $M\\to \\infty.$\n:::\n\n:::{#prp-ci-proportion}\nFor large samples $n$, a $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for the parameter $p$ is given by\n$$\n \\widehat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p} (1-\\widehat{p})}{m}}\\,.\n$$ {#eq-proportion-mean-ci}\n:::\n\nThis follows from @prp-ci-large-sample by observing that @eq-proportion-estimator is a sample mean and replacing the standard error $\\sigma_{\\widehat{p}}$ from @eq-proportion-var by the estimated standard error,\n$$\n \\widehat{\\se}(\\widehat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{p} (1-\\widehat{p})}{m}}\\,;\n$$\nrecall the $s$ in @eq-ci-large-sample) is the sample variance for the *population* and $s / \\sqrt{m} = \\se$ is the standard error of the point estimator.   \n\n:::{#prp-htest-proportion}\nLet $X$ be the count of members with a given property based on a sample of size $m$ from a population where a proportion $p$ shares the property.\nThen $\\widehat{p} = X / m$ is an estimator of $p.$ Assume $m p_0 \\geq 10$ and $m (1-p_0) \\geq 10.$ \n \nConsider $H_0 : p = p_0.$ The test statistic is\n$$\n Z = \\frac{\\widehat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{p_0 (1-p_0) / m}} \\,.\n$$\n\nFor a hypothesis test at level $\\alpha$, we use the following procedure: \n        \nIf $H_a : p > p_0$, then $P$-value is the area under $\\mathsf{N}(0,1)$ to the right of $z.$\n\nIf $H_a : p < p_0$, then $P$-value is the area under $\\mathsf{N}(0,1)$ to the left of $z.$\n\nIf $H_a : p \\neq p_0$, then $P$-value is twice the area under $\\mathsf{N}(0,1)$ to the right of $|z|.$   \n:::    \n\n\n:::{#exm-est-prop-hypothesis-test}\nLet us revisit @exm-htest-setup, where we considered Churchill's claim that he would receive half the votes for the House of Commons seat for the constituency of Dundee. We are sceptical that he is as popular as he says. Suppose 116 out of 263 Dundonians polled claimed they intended to vote for Churchill. Can it be concluded at a significance level of $0.10$ that more than half of all eligible Dundonains will vote for Churchill?\n\nThe parameter of interest is $p$, the proportion of votes for Churchill. The null hypothesis is $$H_0 : p = 0.5\\,,$$ and the alternative hypothesis is, $$H_a : p < 0.5\\,.$$ The test is oneside (i.e. $H_a : p < 0.5$) since we are interested in testing support for \"more than half\". Since $263(0.5) = 131.5 > 10$, we satisfy the assumptions stated in @prp-htest-proportion.\n\nBased on the sample, $\\widehat{p} = 116 / 263 = 0.4411.$ The test statistic value is \n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n z &= \\frac{\\widehat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{p_0 (1-p_0) / m}} \\\\\n &= \\frac{0.4411 - 0.5}{\\sqrt{0.5 (1-0.5) / 263}}\\\\\n &= -1.91  \\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe $P$-value for this lower-tailed $z$ test is  $P = \\Phi(-1.91) = 0.028.$ Since $P < 0.10 = \\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis at the $0.1$ level.
