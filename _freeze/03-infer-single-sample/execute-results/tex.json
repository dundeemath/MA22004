Presently we estimate population means $\\mu$ in Section \\@ref(estimating-means), population proportions $p$ in Section \\@ref(estimating-proportions), and population variances $\\sigma^2$ in Section \\@ref(estimating-variances) in some special cases.  \n\n## Estimating means {#estimating-means}\n\nIf the parameter of interest is the population mean $\\theta = \\mu$, then what can be said about the distribution of the sample mean estimator $\\widehat{\\theta} = \\overline{X}$ in \\@ref(eq:sample-mean)? We will consider three cases,\n\n1. [normal population with known $\\sigma^2$](#mean-normal-var-known),\n2. [any population with unknown $\\sigma^2$, when the sample size $m$ is large](#mean-large-sample), and\n3. [normal population with unknown $\\sigma^2$, when the sample size $m$ is small](#mean-normal-var-unknown).  \n\nIn each, the form of the confidence interval and hypothesis test statistic for $\\mu$ can be derived using the approximate normality of the sample mean.\n\nIn general, the confidence intervals for the mean based on normality theory will have the form:\n\\begin{equation}\n \\text{point estimate}\\; \\mu \\pm (\\text{critical value of reference dist.}) \\cdot (\\text{precision of point estimate})\\,, \n (\\#eq:ci-gen-form)\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the reference distribution will be the standard normal (for 1. and 2.) and the Student's $\\mathsf{t}$ distribution (for 3.). The critical value corresponds to the value under the reference distribution that yields the two-sided (symmetric) tail areas summing to $1-\\alpha$.  \n\n### Mean of a normal population with known variance {#mean-normal-var-known}\n\nWhen sampling from a normal population with a known mean and variance, the estimator for the sample mean is also normal with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2/m$ where $m$ is the sample size.

The confidence level (or reliability) is inversely related to this precision. When the population is normal and the variance is known, determining the sample size necessary to achieve a desired confidence level and precision is an appealing strategy. A general formula for the sample size $m^*$ necessary to achieve an interval width $w$ is obtained at confidence level  $\\alpha$ by equating $w$ to $2z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\sigma /\\sqrt{m^*}$ and then solving for $m^*$. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.proposition .cell-code}\nThe sample size $m$ required to achieve a CI for $\\mu$ with width $w$ at level $\\alpha$ is given by,\n\\begin{equation*}\nm^* = \\left( 2 z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{w} \\right)^2 \\,.\n\\end{equation*}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFrom Proposition \\@ref(prp:ci-select-n-fixed-w-alpha), we see that the smaller the desired $w$, the larger $m^*$ must be (and subsequently, the more effort that must be allocated to data collection).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.example .cell-code}\nIn Example \\@ref(exm:exm-ci-norm-known-var) we identified a $95\\%$ confidence interval for a normal population with known variance.

We will use the statistic $Z$ to determine if there is substantial evidence against $H_0$, i.e. if the distance is too far in a direction consistent with $H_a$. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.proposition .cell-code}\nAssume that we sample $X_1, \\dots, X_m$ from a normal population with mean $\\mu$ and known variance $\\sigma^2$. \n\nConsider $H_0 : \\mu = \\mu_0$.

If $P < \\alpha$, then we reject $H_0$ at level $\\alpha$ as the data provides sufficient evidence at the $\\alpha$ level against the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.example .cell-code}\nLet's return to the data in Example \\@ref(exm:exm-ci-norm-known-var), where we sample from a normal population with a known standard deviation $\\sigma = 17000$. Suppose that someone claims the true mean is $\\mu_0 = 20000$. Does our sample mean $\\overline{x} = 20992$ based on $m = 400$ samples provide evidence to contradict this claim at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level?\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe first thing to record is our parameter of interest: $\\mu$, the true population mean. The null hypothesis, which we assume to be true, is a statement about the value of $\\mu$,\n\\begin{equation*}\n H_0 : \\mu = 20000\\,,\n\\end{equation*}\nand the alternative hypothesis is\n\\begin{equation*}\n H_a : \\mu \\neq 20000\\,,\n\\end{equation*}\nsince we are concerned with a deviation in either direction from $\\mu_0 = 20000$. \n\nSince the population is normal with known variance, we compute the test statistic:\n\\begin{equation*}\n z = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{m}} = \\frac{20992 - 20000}{17000 / \\sqrt{400}} = 1.167\\,.\n\\end{equation*}\nThat is, the observed sample mean $\\overline{x}$ is slightly more than $1$ standard deviation than what we expect under $H_0$. Consulting \\@ref(prp:htest-norm-known-var), we see that a two-tailed test is indicated for this particular $H_a$ (i.e., containing \"$\\neq$\"). The $P$-value is the area,^[Note $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\leq z)$ is found by calling `pnorm(z)` in `r` or by looking up the value in a $Z$ table.]\n\\begin{equation*}\nP = 2(1 - \\Phi(1.167)) = 2 (0.1216052) = 0.2432.\n\\end{equation*}\nThus, since $P = 0.2432 > 0.05 = \\alpha$, we fail to reject $H_0$ at the level $0.05$. The data does not support the claim that the true population mean differs from the value $20000$ at the $0.05$ level. $\\lozenge$   \n\n### Mean of a population with unknown variance (large-sample) {#mean-large-sample}\n\nConsider samples $X_1, \\dots, X_m$ from a population with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$. Provided that $m$ is large enough, the Central Limit Theorem implies that the estimator for the sample mean $\\overline{X}$ in \\@ref(eq:sample-mean) has *approximately* a normal distribution. Then \n\\begin{equation}\nP \\left( - z_{\\alpha/2} < \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{m}} < z_{\\alpha/2} \\right) \\approx 1 - \\alpha\\,,\n\\end{equation}\nsince the transformed variable has approximately a standard normal distribution. Thus, computing a point estimate based on a large $m$ of samples yields a CI for the population parameter $\\mu$ at an *approximate* confidence level $\\alpha$. However, it is often the case that the variance is unknown. When $m$ is large, replacing the population variance $\\sigma^2$ by the sample variance $S^2$ in \\@ref(eq:sample-var) will not typically introduce too much additional variability.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.proposition .cell-code}\nFor a large sample size $m$, an approximate $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for the mean $\\mu$ of any population when the variance is unknown is given by \n\\begin{equation} \n \\left(\\overline{x} - z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{m}} \\,, \n        \\overline{x} + z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{m}} \\right)\\,,  \n (\\#eq:ci-large-sample)\n\\end{equation}\nor $\\overline{x} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot s / \\sqrt{m}$. \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe CI for the mean \\@ref(eq:ci-large-sample) applies regardless of the shape of the population distribution so long as the number of samples is large.

However, this rule of thumb won't apply if you want to consider some different level, say $80\\%$ [@vanBelle:2008rt, §1].] In words, the CI \\@ref(eq:ci-large-sample) can be expressed (cf. \\@ref(eq:ci-gen-form)) as\n\\begin{equation*}\n \\text{point estimate}\\; \\mu \\pm \n (z \\;\\text{critical value}) \\cdot (\\text{estimated standard error of mean})\\,.\n\\end{equation*}\nTypically, a large-sample CI for a general parameter $\\theta$ holds that is similar to \\@ref(eq:ci-large-sample) for any estimator $\\widehat{\\theta}$ that satisfies: (1) approximately normal in distribution, (2) approximately unbiased, and (3) an expression for the standard error is available.\n\nTo conduct a large-sample hypothesis test regarding the population mean $\\mu$, we consider the test statistic\n\\begin{equation*}\n Z = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{S / \\sqrt{m}}\n\\end{equation*}\nunder the null hypothesis, i.e., we replace the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ with the sample standard deviation $S$. When the number of samples $m$ is large (say $m > 40$), then $Z$ will be approximately normal. Substituting this test statistic $Z$ for \\@ref(eq:htest-norm-known-var-T), we follow Proposition \\@ref(prp:htest-norm-known-var) to determine how to calculate the $P$-value.  \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.example .cell-code}\nConsider the **Iris Data** from \\@ref(point-estimation) and use the `infer` package to make inferences.

The proportion $p \\in (0,1)$ of the population satisfying the given property is a parameter characterising the population we might be interested in estimating. A sample of classified observations, $X_1, \\dots, X_m \\sim \\mathsf{Bernoulli}(p)$, from the population contains a proportion,\n\\begin{equation}\n \\widehat{p} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m X_i\\,,\n (\\#eq:proportion-estimator)\n\\end{equation}\nsatisfying the given property.
