Hi, folks!

I'm Eric---your instructor for MA22004 this semester. I am a new Baxter Fellow in Applied Mathematics at Dundee, and my research focuses on uncertainty quantification and predictive modelling.  

Originally from the US, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BA in Mathematics. I wrote my PhD in Probability and Stochastic Analysis at the University of Edinburgh.  Math and stats have opened up some exciting doors for me, and I've had the opportunity to undertake postdoctoral work at KTH Stockholm, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and RWTH Aachen University. I'm very excited to be at Dundee and back in Scotland. I'm even more excited to be teaching you statistics this semester!
