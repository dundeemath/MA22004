# Lab Guide {-#labs}

You will learn about the statistical programming language `R` and the software RStudio by working through seven interactive lab tutorials and by completing lab reports. The lab reports consist of the answers to exercise questions that are contained at the end of each tutorial. 

Tutorials and all associated materials (templates, data sets, further instructions, etc) are available as an `R` package at the GitHub repository `dundeemath/MA22004labs` (i.e., [https://github.com/dundeemath/MA22004labs](https://github.com/dundeemath/MA22004labs)).  

Instructions on how to install and access the interactive lab tutorials can be found at:

The next section contains details about lab reports.
