[Concise general reference] Assessment The module will be continuously assessed using coursework and examinations. Deadlines, as well as test dates, will be posted on Ultra and announcements made in the class hours. The module assessment weighting is as follows. Assessment Weight Assignments 20% Midterm Exam 1 20% Midterm Exam 2 20% Final Exam 40% Coursework Assessed coursework includes: six hand-in laboratory reports and weekly engagement with the reading material using Perusall. There will also be alternative means of demonstrating your mastery of course material through: one (group) lab presentation and short seminar quizzes (announced in advance). Examinations The Midterm Exams will be computer-assessed and will be one (1) hour in scope. These will likely be in weeks 4 and 8. The Final Exam will be a two (2) hour hand-written exam that will be submitted using Gradescope. This process will be thoroughly discussed and trialled with a dummy exam in advance of the real submission. The Final Exam will be in week 11 (i.e., during the last week of the term). To pass this module, you must: obtain an overall grade of at least D3 in the overall assessment and obtain a grade of at least M1 for the exam and obtain a grade of at least M1 for the coursework. For those who fail the module, there may be an opportunity to take a two-hour resit examination paper at the next available exam diet. ⚠️ Resit marks are based on the resit exam only. Unless you have mitigating circumstances, if you fail to achieve a module grade of CF or above at first attempt, then you may not be permitted to resit the exam. Also, unless you have mitigating circumstances, any pass after a resit will be capped at a grade of D3 regardless of the weighted average mark obtained. Your Commitment You should attend all synchronous timetabled sessions except on medical grounds or with the special permission of Dr Hall. If you are unable to attend the degree examination or complete elements of the coursework on time, then you should inform Dr Hall and submit a medical certificate. Medical certificates should be submitted to your School Office as soon as possible after the absence. ⚠️ You must also submit a Mitigating Circumstances form to explain which aspects of assessment have been affected by your absence. A Medical Certificate will only be taken into account if accompanied by a completed Mitigating Circumstances form that refers to the medical certificate. Approved Calculators The Casio FX83 and the Casio FX85 are the only calculators approved for use in assessments in the School of Engineering, Physics and Mathematics. Study Support If you are having difficulty with the course, you are encouraged to seek help at an early stage by making an appointment with Dr Hall. You may also obtain additional help from the Maths Base (see Ultra for details).

End of Module Questionaire You will have the opportunity to complete a confidential questionnaire regarding the content and presentation of the module periodically. These questionaires form an important element in the University’s Academic Standards procedures. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. "],
["preliminaries.html", "Preliminaries Notation Abbreviations Normal distribution", " Preliminaries Notation Uppercase roman letters, e.g., \\(X\\), will typically denote random variables (rvs); lower case letters, e.g., \\(x\\), will denote a particular value (observation) of a rv. Rvs have probability distributions. Distributions are typically characterized by parameters which are fixed real numbers. Parameters describe population characteristics that are often unknown and must be estimated from data. Statistical inference is a tool that will help us to do this. ⚠️ Statistical models comprise both rvs and parameters. Be careful not to confuse them! Abbreviations Normal distribution Normal distributions play an important role in probability and statistics as they describes many natural phenomenon. For instance, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that sums of rvs are approximately Normal in distribution. Definition 0.1 A continuous rv \\(X\\) has a normal distribution with parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\), where \\(-\\infty &lt; \\mu &lt; \\infty\\) and \\(\\sigma &gt; 0\\), if \\(X\\) has pdf \\[ f(x; \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sigma}e^{-(x-\\mu)^2/(2\\sigma^2)}\\,, \\quad -\\infty &lt; x &lt; \\infty \\,.\\] The statement that \\(X\\) is normally distributed with parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is abbreviated \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). For \\(X\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), it can be shown that \\(\\operatorname{E}(X) = \\mu\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2\\), that is, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance of \\(X\\). The pdf takes the form of a bell-shaped curve that is symmetric about \\(\\mu\\). The value \\(\\sigma\\) (standard deviation) is the distance from \\(\\mu\\) to the inflection points of the curve. Thus, the position (location) and spread of the distribution depends on \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). Figure 0.1: The pdfs of two normal rvs with different means and the same standard deviations. Figure 0.2: The pdfs of two normal rvs with the same means and different standard deviations. Definition 0.2 We say that \\(X\\) has a standard Normal distribution if \\(\\mu=0\\) and \\(\\sigma = 1\\) and we will usually denote standard Normal rvs by \\(Z\\) (why? tradition!). Some useful facts about Normals Here are some useful facts about how to manipulate Normal rvs. If \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2),\\) then \\(Z = (X - \\mu) / \\sigma \\quad \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1).\\) If \\(Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1),\\) then \\(X = \\mu + \\sigma Z \\quad \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2).\\) If \\(X_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_i, \\sigma_i^2)\\) for \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\) are independent rvs, then \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mu_i, \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sigma_i^2 \\right) \\,.\\] In particular, we note that for differences of independent rvs \\(X_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1^2)\\) and \\(X_2 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2^2)\\) then the variances also add: \\[ X_1 - X_2 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1 + \\mu_2, \\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2) \\,.\\] Probabilities \\(P(a \\leq X \\leq b)\\) are found by converting the problem in \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) to the standard normal distribution \\(Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\) whose probability values \\(\\Phi(z) = P(Z\\leq z)\\) can then be looked up in a table. From (1.) above, \\[\\begin{aligned} P(a &lt; X &lt; b) &amp;= P\\left( \\frac{a-\\mu}{\\sigma} &lt; Z &lt; \\frac{b-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\Phi \\left( \\frac{b-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\,. \\end{aligned}\\] Example 0.1 Let \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(5, 9)\\) and find \\(P(X \\geq 5.5)\\). \\[\\begin{aligned} P(X \\geq 5.5) &amp;= P\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{5.5 - 5}{3}\\right) \\\\ &amp;= P(Z \\geq 0.1667) \\\\ &amp;= 1 - P(Z \\leq 0.1667) \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\Phi(0.1667) \\\\ &amp;= 1 - 0.5662 \\\\ &amp;= 0.4338\\,, \\end{aligned}\\] where we look up the value of \\(\\Phi(z) = P(Z\\leq z)\\) in a table of standard normal curve areas. Alternatively, we can use the r code: pnorm(5.5, mean = 5, sd = 3, lower.tail = FALSE) [1] 0.4338162 TODO: plot of area under normal curve (right tail) Example 0.2 Let \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(5, 9)\\) and find \\(P(4 \\leq X \\leq 5.25)\\). \\[\\begin{aligned} P(4 \\leq X \\leq 5.25) &amp;= P\\left(\\frac{4-5}{3} \\leq Z \\leq \\frac{5.25-5}{3}\\right) \\\\ &amp;= P(-0.3333 \\leq Z \\leq 0.0833) \\\\ &amp;= \\Phi(0.0833) - \\Phi(-0.3333) \\\\ &amp;= 0.5332 - 0.3694 \\\\ &amp;= 0.1638\\,. \\end{aligned}\\] where we look up the value of \\(\\Phi(z) = P(Z\\leq z)\\) in a table of standard normal curve areas.

["statistical-inference.html", "1 Basics of statistical inference 1.1 Point estimation 1.2 Confidence intervals 1.3 Hypothesis testing", " 1 Basics of statistical inference 1.1 Point estimation A statistic is a quantity that can be calculated from sample data. Prior to obtaining data, a statistic is an unknown quantity and is therefore a rv. We refer to the probability distribution for a statistic as a sampling distribution to emphasize how the distribution will vary across all possible sample data. Statistical inference seeks to draw conclusions about the characteristics of a population from data. For example, suppose we are botanists interested in taxonomic classification of iris flowers. Let \\(\\mu\\) denote the true average petal length (in cm) of the Iris setosa (AKA the bristle-pointed iris). The parameter \\(\\mu\\) is a characteristic of the whole population for the setosa species. Before we collect data, the petal lengths of \\(n\\) independent setosa flowers are denoted by rvs \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\). Any function of the \\(X_i\\)’s, such as the sample mean, \\[\\begin{equation} \\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\,, \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] or the sample variance, \\[\\begin{equation*} S^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline{X})^2 \\,, \\end{equation*}\\] is also a rv. Suppose we actually find and measure the petal length of \\(50\\) independent setosa flowers resulting in observations \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{50}\\); the distribution (counts) of \\(50\\) such petal length measurements are displayed in Figure 1.1. The sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) for petal length could then be used to draw a conclusion about the value of the population mean \\(\\mu\\). Similarly, if \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance of the setosa petal length then \\(s^2\\) can be used to infer something about the value of \\(\\sigma^2\\). Based on the data in Figure 1.1 and using (1.1), the value of the sample mean is \\(\\overline{x} = 1.462\\). The value \\(\\overline{x}\\) provides a “best guess” or point estimate for the true value of \\(\\mu\\) based on the \\(n=50\\) samples. Figure 1.1: The distribution (counts) of \\(50\\) setosa petal length measurments. The botonist Edgar Anderson’s Iris Data contains three plant species (setosa, virginica, versicolor) and four features (sepal length &amp; width, petal length &amp; width) measured in cm for each sample. This data set can be accessed in r by loading library(datasets) and then calling data(iris). Definition 1.1 A point estimate of a parameter \\(\\theta\\) (recall: a fixed, unknown quantity) is a single number that we regard as a sensible value for \\(\\theta\\). Let \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) be iid samples from a distribution \\(F(\\theta)\\). A point estimator \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_n\\) of a parameter \\(\\theta\\) is obtained by selecting a suitable statistic \\(g\\), \\[\\begin{equation*} \\widehat{\\theta}_n = g(X_1, \\dots, X_n) \\,. \\end{equation*}\\] A point estimate \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_n\\) can then be computed from the estimator using sample data. ⚠️ The symbol \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_n\\) (or simply \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) when the sample size \\(n\\) is clear from context) is typically used to denote both the estimator and the point estimate resulting from a given sample. Note that writing, e.g., \\(\\widehat{\\theta} = 42\\) does not indicate how the point estimate was obtained. Therefore, it is essential to report both the estimator and the resulting point estimate. Note that Definition 1.1 above does not say how to select the appropriate statistic. For the setosa example, the sample mean \\(\\overline{X}\\) is suggested as a good estimator of the population mean \\(\\mu\\). That is, \\(\\widehat{\\mu} = \\overline{X}\\) or “the point estimator of \\(\\mu\\) is the sample mean \\(\\overline{X}\\)”. Here, while \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are fixed quantities representing characteristics of the population, \\(\\overline{X}\\) and \\(S^2\\) are rvs with sampling distributions. If the population is normally distributed or if the sample is large then the sampling distribution for \\(\\overline{X}\\) has a known form: \\(\\overline{X}\\) is normal with mean \\(\\mu_{\\overline{X}} = \\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{X}} = \\sigma^{2} / n\\), i.e., \\[\\begin{equation*} \\overline{X} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2} / n) \\,, \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(n\\) is the sample size and \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are the (typically unknown) population parameters. Example 1.1 Let us consider the heights (measured in inches) of \\(31\\) black cherry trees (sorted, for your enjoyment): [1] 63 64 65 66 69 70 71 72 72 74 74 75 75 75 76 76 77 78 79 80 80 80 80 80 81 [26] 81 82 83 85 86 87 The quantile-quantile normal probability plot of this data is quite straight, so we assume that the distribution of black cherry tree heights is normal with a mean value \\(\\mu\\). The observations \\(X_1, \\dots, X_{31}\\) are then assumed to be a random sample from this normal distribution. Consider the following estimators and resulting point estimates for \\(\\mu\\). Estimator (sample mean) \\(\\overline{X}\\) as in (1.1) and estimate \\(\\overline{x} = \\sum x_i / n = 2356 / 31 = 76\\). Estimator (average of extreme heights) \\(\\widetilde{X} = [\\min(X_i) + \\max(X_i)]/2\\) and estimate \\(\\widetilde{x} = (63 + 87)/2 = 75\\). Estimator (\\(10\\%\\) trimmed mean – i.e., in this instance exclude the smallest and largest three values) \\(\\overline{X}_{\\text{tr}(10)}\\) and estimate \\(\\overline{x}_{\\text{tr}(10)} = (2356 - 63 - 64 - 65 - 87 - 86 - 85) / 25 = 76.24\\). Each estimator above uses a different notion of center for the sample data. An interesting question to think about is: which estimator will tend to produce estimates closest to the true parameter value? Will the estimators work universally well for all distributions? ```` TODO: insert exercise 19 p 61 from All of Stats. Don’t confuse distribution of data from distribution of statistic. Don’t confuse sampling distribution with population distribution. In addition to reporting a point estimate (together with its estimator), some indication of its precision should be given. One measure of the precision in an estimate is to report its standard error. Definition 1.2 The standard error of an estimator \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is the standard deviation \\(\\sigma_{\\widehat{\\theta}} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{\\theta})}\\) (sometimes denoted \\(\\mathsf{se}= \\mathsf{se}(\\widehat{\\theta})\\)). Often, the standard error depends on unknown parameters and must also be estimated. The estimated standard error is denoted by \\(\\widehat{\\sigma}_{\\widehat{\\theta}}\\) or \\(s_{\\widehat{\\theta}}\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mathsf{se}}\\). 1.2 Confidence intervals 1.3 Hypothesis testing "]
