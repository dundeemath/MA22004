## Organisation {-#cg-organization}

This module runs for 11 teaching weeks and is worth 20 SCQF credits (equivalently, 10 ECTS points). All organisation and teaching will be carried out by:

--------------------
Dr Eric Hall
[ehall001@dundee.ac.uk](mailto:ehall001@dundee.ac.uk)

Mathematics Division
Room TBA,
Fulton Building

01382 TBA
--------------------

This course uses [Blackboard Ultra](my.dundee.ac.uk) (look for course `MA22004_SEM0000_2021`) for communicating all announcements/deadlines and also for running online meetings. This course also uses [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) for submission of some of the continuous assessment items and [Perusall](https://perusall.com/) for collaborative engagement with reading materials.

If you have a problem regarding the course, then you should make an appointment to see Dr Hall. You may also bring matters of concern about the course to the attention of the Mathematics Division Staff/Student Committee, which meets once each semester. A volunteer from Level 2 Mathematics will act as class representative to sit on the Staff/Student Committee (see Ultra for contact details).

## Timetable {-#cg-timetable}

> ⚠️ Due to COVID19, these plans may be subject to change. 

The delivery of this module consists of a blend of synchronous and asynchronous content delivered both in-person and online. On an average week, there will be seven planned teaching and learning activities.

The anticipated student effort is 200 hours over the length of the module. You are expected to be "present" for all synchronous timetabled activities except for the online office hours, which are optional. You may engage with the asynchronous material at your own pace, keeping in mind to meet any deadlines for engagement and/or attainment that will be posted to Ultra and discussed.

## Assessment {-#cg-assessment}

The module will be *continuously* assessed using coursework and examinations. Deadlines, as well as test dates, will be posted on Ultra and announcements made in the class hours. The module assessment weighting is as follows.

### Coursework {-#cg-assessment-coursework}

Assessed coursework includes:

- six hand-in laboratory reports and 
- weekly engagement with the reading material using [Perusall](https://perusall.com/). 

There will also be alternative means of demonstrating your mastery of course material through:

- one (group) lab presentation and
- short seminar quizzes (announced in advance).

### Examinations {-#cg-assessment-exams}

The **Midterm Exams** will be computer-assessed and will be one (1) hour in scope. These will likely be in weeks 4 and 8. 

The **Final Exam** will be a two (2) hour hand-written exam that will be submitted using [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). This process will be thoroughly discussed and trialled with a dummy exam in advance of the real submission. The Final Exam will be in week 11 (i.e., during the last week of the term).

To pass this module, you must:

- obtain an overall grade of at least `D3` in the overall assessment **and** 
- obtain a grade of at least `M1` for the exam **and** 
- obtain a grade of at least `M1` for the coursework.

For those who fail the module, there may be an opportunity to take a two-hour resit examination paper at the next available exam diet. 

> ⚠️ Resit marks are based on the resit exam only.

Unless you have mitigating circumstances, if you fail to achieve a module grade of `CF` or above at first attempt, then you may not be permitted to resit the exam. Also, unless you have mitigating circumstances, any pass after a resit will be capped at a grade of `D3` regardless of the weighted average mark obtained.  

## Your Commitment {-#cg-commitment}

You should attend all synchronous timetabled sessions except on medical grounds or with the special permission of Dr Hall. If you are unable to attend the degree examination or complete elements of the coursework on time, then you should inform Dr Hall and submit a medical certificate. Medical certificates should be submitted to your School Office as soon as possible after the absence.

> ⚠️ You must also submit a Mitigating Circumstances form to explain which aspects of assessment have been affected by your absence.

A Medical Certificate will only be taken into account if accompanied by a completed Mitigating Circumstances form that refers to the medical certificate.

## Approved Calculators {-#cg-calcs}

The Casio FX83 and the Casio FX85 are the only calculators approved for use in assessments in the School of Engineering, Physics and Mathematics.

## Study Support {-#cg-support}

If you are having difficulty with the course, you are encouraged to seek help at an early stage by making an appointment with Dr Hall. You may also obtain additional help from the Maths Base (see Ultra for details).

## Disability {-#cg-disability}

The University of Dundee is committed to making reasonable, effective and appropriate accommodations to meet the needs of students with disabilities and to create an inclusive and barrier-free campus. If you require accommodation for a documented disability, then you are advised to register with [Disability Services](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/disabilityservices/). Please communicate any needs you may have directly with Dr Hall and as soon as possible to ensure timely management of any accommodations. 

## Academic Honesty {-#cg-honesty}

Honesty in scholarship and research is integral to the integrity of the academic enterprise of any higher education institution. Therefore, all students at the University of Dundee must practice academic honesty. Academic dishonesty includes cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating dishonesty. Cases of academic dishonesty will be subject to appropriate sanctions and ignorance of such standards is not sufficient evidence of lack of intent. Please see the [*Code of Practice on Academic Misconduct by Students*](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/qf/documents/details/academic-misconduct.php) for more information about what constitutes academic dishonesty.

## End of Module Questionaire {-#cg-questionaire}

You will have the opportunity to complete a confidential questionnaire regarding the content and presentation of the module periodically. These questionaires form an important element in the University's Academic Standards procedures. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
