## Notation {-}

Uppercase roman letters, e.g., $X$, will typically denote random variables (rvs); lower case letters, e.g., $x$, will denote a particular value (observation) of a rv. Rvs have probability distributions. Distributions are typically characterized by *parameters* which are fixed real numbers. Parameters describe population characteristics that are often unknown and must be estimated from data. Statistical inference is a tool that will help us to do this.

> ⚠️  Statistical models comprise both rvs and parameters. Be careful not to confuse them!
